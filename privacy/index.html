    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how DeskXP (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when you visit our website <strong>deskxp.com</strong> or interact with our services. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data in compliance with applicable laws, including the <strong>Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Philippines)</strong>, <strong>GDPR (EU)</strong>, and <strong>CCPA (California)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information that is necessary to deliver our services or communicate with you, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal details you provide — such as name, email address, company, or phone number.</li>
      <li>Information submitted through forms (e.g. Calendly booking, contact forms).</li>
      <li>Technical data such as IP address, browser type, and device information (via GitHub Pages and Google Fonts logs).</li>
      <li>Optional cookies or analytics data if you accept them (see “Cookies and Analytics” below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respond to inquiries and provide requested services.</li>
      <li>Schedule and manage consultations through Calendly.</li>
      <li>Improve our website’s performance and usability.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations or enforce agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We process personal data under one or more of the following bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> – you have given permission for a specific purpose (e.g. contact or scheduling).</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> – to operate and improve our services in a reasonable and expected manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligation</strong> – when processing is necessary to comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <p>Our site does not use tracking cookies by default. However, if analytics tools (e.g. Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) are later added, you will be notified and given an option to consent or decline before any data is collected.</p>
    <p>You can manage or delete cookies in your browser settings at any time.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use trusted third-party platforms to deliver and secure our content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> – website hosting and delivery.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> – font delivery via secure CDN.</li>
      <li><strong>Calendly</strong> – scheduling and booking management.</li>
      <li><strong>Email / Cloud Providers</strong> – communication and file storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may process limited technical data (e.g. IP, device, usage) in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for business or legal purposes. Contact and scheduling information is stored for up to <strong>12 months</strong> unless you request earlier deletion.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use SSL encryption, access controls, and limited storage practices to safeguard your information. While no method is 100% secure, we continually review our security measures to protect your data against loss or misuse.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. Information may be shared only with service providers acting on our behalf and bound by confidentiality and data processing agreements. Data may be transferred to servers located outside your country, but only where adequate protection is ensured.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access and obtain a copy of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion (“right to be forgotten”).</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li>Complain to your local data protection authority if you believe your rights are violated.</li>
    </ul>
